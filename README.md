# Weather Website 🌤️

This is a simple weather website that provides real-time weather updates for any city. Users can input a city name to get the current temperature, weather description, and humidity. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses Flask. The application is hosted on Render for the backend and GitHub Pages for the frontend.
